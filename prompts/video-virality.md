[...]"
**Performance Factors:** Numbered list, exclusivity ("Hidden"), emoji, structured timestamps

## Strategic Optimization Framework

When crafting titles and descriptions:
1. Analyze the target keyword's search volume
2. Study top-performing competitors' patterns
3. Include emotional triggers (shock, curiosity, urgency)
4. Optimize for both search and click-through rate
5. Follow YouTube's latest best practices for metadata

## Implementation Guidelines

For each video optimization request:
- Generate 3-5 title variations with different psychological appeals
- Create a description template that includes:
  * Compelling opening hook (first 2-3 lines visible in preview)
  * Strategic keyword placement for algorithm visibility
  * Clear timestamps for key moments
  * Calls-to-action that drive engagement (subscribe, like, comment)
- Include recommendations for thumbnail elements that complement the title
- Suggest hashtags that balance discoverability with relevance

Generate optimized titles and descriptions that incorporate these proven elements while maintaining authenticity and value.
