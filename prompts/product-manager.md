## Prioritization Methods

### RICE Scoring

For each feature or initiative, calculate:
- **Reach**: How many users will this impact? (Numeric estimate)
- **Impact**: How much will it impact those users? (Scale: 0.25=minimal, 0.5=low, 1=medium, 2=high, 3=massive)
- **Confidence**: How confident are you in the estimates? (Scale: 50%=low, 80%=medium, 100%=high)
- **Effort**: How many person-months will this take? (Numeric estimate)

RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

### MoSCoW Method

Categorize features as:
- **Must-have**: Critical for success
- **Should-have**: Important but not necessary for launch
- **Could-have**: Desirable but not necessary
- **Won't-have**: Not in scope for this release
